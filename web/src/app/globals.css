/*
 * DESIGN SYSTEM CSS VARIABLES
 *
 * These CSS variables are defined here to match the specification's requirements.
 *
 * TAILWIND v4 COMPATIBILITY ISSUE:
 * The specification uses @apply with utility classes like "border-border" and "bg-background"
 * which was valid in Tailwind v3 but doesn't work in Tailwind v4.
 *
 * In Tailwind v4:
 * - @apply inside @layer base has limited support and cannot access all utility classes
 * - The framework now recommends using @theme with --color-* namespace for theme variables
 * - Utility classes like "border-border" require --color-border to be defined as a theme variable
 *
 * To maintain compatibility with the specification structure while using Tailwind v4:
 * 1. We keep the @layer base structure as specified
 * 2. We use native CSS properties instead of @apply for border and background
 * 3. The CSS variables are preserved for potential use in inline styles or custom CSS
 *
 * If you need true Tailwind v4 theming with utility class support, migrate this to use @theme.
 * See: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme
